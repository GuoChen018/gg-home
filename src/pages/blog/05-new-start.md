I'm starting my first full-time job tomorrow. 

> damn...Damn...DAMN
> 

I'll be working at [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) as a product designer in NYC. For the past few weeks, I've just been settling into my new place. Designing the space on Figma; looking at 100+ furnitures; assembling them: The usual move-in process. 

As I'm much more settled in, I wanted to take some time to note down some thoughts before work. These are a bit scattered - so bare with me. 

## Joining Datadog 
Last summer, I worked as a product design intern there on the [Logs Management](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/log-management/) team. It was my favorite internship thus far. So, I'm super excited to go back. 

I will work under [Carl Nelson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlrnelson) on the Data Observability team.

## Finding a community 
I may or may not write another post about this. But here is a quick glimpse into how I thought about this. 

For me, it'll be a mix of re-finding my old self and entering a new stage. 

### Re-finding my old self 
> What do you mean? Which part of your old self?

#### Running
Well, it's the me who, back in high school, obsessed over running. I wouldn't call myself a running fanatic back then, but I was quite close. During the season, I would compete with my teammates to see who ran most during the weekends (e.g. 18km run on a Sunday). One time off-season, we even decided to run 34km together. And we did do it.

> Was it tiring? Absolutely. But was it one of the best times I've had in high school - HELL YEA!

To me - running is a lifestyle. A lifestyle of discipline, routine, and the willingness to push your body a little more. And I absolutely love it. 

A few days ago, I did a speed workout with a running club called [no more lonely runs](https://www.instagram.com/p/C-yagO8vOQC/?hl=en&img_index=1) at a [park track](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vBBH5wuRzdJZMKbHA).

We did 6 x 800m. And I vividly remember  in one of the last sets, I thought to myself: 

> HOLY F THIS IS TIRING. MY STOMACH IS REALLY CRAMPING UP. BUT MAN IT FEELS SO DAMN GOOD TO RUN WITH SO MANY PEOPLE AROUND!!!!
> 

At that moment, I knew that running will be a strong anchor in my after-grad life. 

#### Guitar 
I used to play a decent amount of guitar. Nothing fancy - mostly just playing chords so I can sing over it or sometimes solos.

But, it's been a while since I consistently practiced guitar. And I want to get back to it. 

I'm planning to mostly focus on guitar covers (no-vocal) of j-pop/anime songs. If I feel like it, I may learn some songs to sing. But that'll be rare. 

> Why anime songs in particular? 
> 

Hmm.. mostly just because I like anime...? Plus, I used my internship money to buy my first ever electric guitar after watching [Bocchi the Rock](https://myanimelist.net/anime/47917/Bocchi_the_Rock). Yes - I did.

Now, on top of re-finding my old self, I noted that I'm entering a new stage. 

### Entering a new stage 
A new stage of self-exploration. A stage where I try to meet as many people. A stage where I explore new hobbies. A stage where I fully push myself as an introvert. 

#### Talking to more people 
To do so, I intend to go to as many situations as I can where I'll be in a room with lots of strangers. I want to push myself to open up conversations and talk to more people. 

I read about this in a book titled "[This is so New York](https://a.co/d/cEW8xX0)," and I think the writer ([Jason Diamond](https://www.jasondiamond.net/)) wrote it brilliantly: 

> It's so expensive [in NYC], but talking to people is free. It's also free *not* to talk to people, but I don't really understand why you'd come here and do that. [The] thing that makes New York City wonderful is and always has been the people, and we love to talk. You do that and I think you'll do fine. 
> 

In terms of new hobbies, I haven't thought that much about this yet. But some I can think of are: 
* Latte art 
* Volleyball (for the lolz since I just finished watching [Haikyu](https://myanimelist.net/anime/20583/Haikyuu) - so insanely good) 
* Going to sauna (I loved the sauna in Oslo, Norway)

#### Photography 
This is a newly picked up hobby. And I love it. 

As of right now, I don't have a camera. I use an app called ProCCD, and I paid $0.99 for a filter. I post my photos on my new Instagram account - [018_guo](https://www.instagram.com/018_guo?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==). 

I mostly photograph to document. I'm not obsessed over a perfect angle. But I do try to take good pictures (aiming for vibes only). My main inspiration is [Daniel Simmon's vlogs](https://www.youtube.com/@imdanielsimmons/videos).

## Game on!

And that's a wrap for my recent thoughts. I am extremely excited to start work. And if you're in NYC and want to chat, shoot me a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/guo_hq) (I will not say X). Will love to chat!
